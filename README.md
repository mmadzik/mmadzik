I am a graduate of Spatial Economy with a specialization in Socio-Economic Analytics. I currently work with GIS systems, where I am expanding my experience in collecting, processing, and analyzing spatial and quantitative data. I use ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Enterprise, and QGIS to create analyses, models, and data visualizations.
My professional goal is to continue the specialization developed during my master’s studies by further improving my data analysis skills and applying them in my professional work.
